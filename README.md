Trellix is a dedicated website designed exclusively for interviewers and candidates, aiming to make the learning and interview process enjoyable and effortless.

1) The code editing feature is accessible to both interviewers and candidates, empowering candidates to provide input and optimize the code.

2) The Doubt Section allows candidates to ask questions about specific lines or sections of code, enabling interviewers to promptly identify and address areas of uncertainty.

3) Our Code Collab page has been thoughtfully designed to ensure a seamless learning experience for both interviewers and candidates, allowing them to explore and ask questions comfortably.

4) To participate, candidates simply need to enter the Code Room Unique ID shared by the interviewer, granting them uninterrupted access to the learning resources.

5) To facilitate communication and awareness, all participants will receive alert notifications, such as when a new member joins or someone asks a doubt. These notifications ensure that everyone remains informed and up-to-date with the ongoing activities.

6) We have strived to present all these features and benefits using clear and concise language, fostering an environment conducive to effective learning and collaboration between interviewers and candidates.
